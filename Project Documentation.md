## Overview of Scrum Board

#### Maintaining Master Plan
Timeline dictates the schedule in which our group will go on, with the tickets reflecting assignment of tasks to each individual 
SCRUM MASTER COMMENT: We were overall on schedule to completing the project on time, although since we did not leave much time to spare for fine-tuning details in the project, aspects of the project may be messy or not look polished on the frontend. Additionally, we struggled slightly in the end of 2nd and beginning of 3rd week since much of the group was out with COVID. Our group still maintained in contact w/ eachother (and scrum master), but since people were working at different times, it was not as ideal as getting work done together in class.
Still, we **completed our major features** in time

## sponsor assessment
* likes the overall design/layout of the website
* finds the database to be cool (especially ability to add notes to each student), but manually entering information for each student is not ideal
* like how easy the random generator is to use (wishes the html display for it would be more organized)
* OVERALL: liked the design, features, and use of our project!

## Team Assessment
20/21 (not including 5 for seed, 5 for teacher final assessment, and 4 for individual assignments and completion)
* Overall, we were organized and followed the timeline closely. Towards the end, our group struggled with efficiency (due to absences because of COVID), but I'm actually really proud of the group for still remaining active in the group chat and through individual messages and getting things done when asked to :). We still made good progress and had an (almost) complete final project to show at N@TM!

## Notes on project progress:
Week 1 notes: 
* started off strong; all group members were active, website was deployed, major features were started

Week 2 notes: 
* database & randomization algorithm (main features) were making good progress, ran into issues with layout/frontend HTML aspects

Week 3 notes:
* ran short on time (didn't work as efficiently due to members missing)
* still finished major features, but wasn't as polished as I (scrum master) would have liked it to be.
