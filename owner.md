### Requirements from project owner:
* Randomly generate the seating chart
* Have an easy-to-use function for inputting names (either drop a .txt file or something along those lines)
* Have a feature where, after the seating chart is generated, students can be moved around as the user would see fit (e.g. move cells in the table)
* the ability to increase text and grid size for improved visablity
* grid will automatically resize to adapt to avaliable space on program window

OTHER FEATURES THAT MAY BE HELPFUL
* data presets --> store (in a database potentially) what old tables looked like 
* have students formatteed in a 9 by 9 grid
