## Ideation:
Our website is a seating chart generator, which will allow a user to input names of students from their class and will return a random seating chart. Users will be able to easily create random groups of a size of their choosing, in addition to future features like being able to move people around, etc.

## Purpose:
Our website was created to help teachers easily create random seating charts that they can also customize. Our project owner is Mr. Jenkins, an AP Statistics teacher at Del Norte High School who has a use for a website like this. Our website models basic requirements and suggestions given by Mr. Jenkins to create a useful and easy-to-use seating chart generator. 

## Project Owner: Mr. Jenkins
### Requirements from project owner:
* Randomly generate the seating chart
* Have an easy-to-use function for inputting names (either drop a .txt file or something along those lines)
* Have a feature where, after the seating chart is generated, students can be moved around as the user would see fit (e.g. move cells in the table)

OTHER FEATURES THAT MAY BE HELPFUL
* data presets --> store (in a database potentially) what old tables looked like 


## Project Idea & Wireframes:

Our website will have many pages and a navigation bar to access those pages.

The home page will have: 1) who we are       2) our project idea & inspiration     3)How to access our github/ guide

Home page example:
![Home Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40574565/157780123-ac5e6886-6f5c-4720-9def-595de35d1a04.png)

##### Form for teachers to enter specific requirements
Fits the MVC requirements & will look something like this: 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40574565/157780850-ff6eaabb-3362-40e0-8381-f889e46ac0ad.png)


##### The seating chart will have names likely  be displayed in a table like so:

* This will be easiest to accomodate teachers with different table group sizes, and make the website more adaptable and personalizable even if it is "uglier"
* We could have a "diagram" of tables, but this would be hard to accomodate for if we want to expand to different classrooms which may have different class setups.
* Note, the seating chart will also have features to 

## Success Idea (What a successful project looks like)
A successful project functions properly to create random seating charts, but also allows user to move around cells in the table. It will be something Mr. Jenkins is satisfied with and is actually capable of creating something random.
