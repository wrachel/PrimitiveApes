## Ideation: Seater
Our website is a seating chart generator, which will allow a user to input names of students from their class and will return a random seating chart of a defined table size. Users will be able to easily create random groups of a size of their choosing in a 9 X 9 grid,in addition to future features like being able to move people around and the ability to increase text and grid size for improved visablity. 

## Purpose:
Our website will help teachers easily create random seating charts that they can also customize. Our project owner is Mr. Jenkins, an AP Statistics teacher at Del Norte High School who often uses a program to create his seating chart. Our website models basic requirements and suggestions given by Mr. Jenkins to create a useful and easy-to-use seating chart generator.
