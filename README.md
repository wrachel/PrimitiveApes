## Ideation:
Our website is a seating chart generator, which will allow a user to input names of students from their class and will return a random seating chart. Users will be able to easily create random groups of a size of their choosing, in addition to future features like being able to move people around, etc.

## Purpose:
Our website was created to help teachers easily create random seating charts that they can also customize. Our project owner is Mr. Jenkins, an AP Statistics teacher at Del Norte High School who has a use for a website like this. Our website models basic requirements and suggestions given by Mr. Jenkins to create a useful and easy-to-use seating chart generator. 

## Usage:
Clone project and run the project locally. Deployed website coming soon.
