# Technical Completion Overview
Things that are completed: 
* Implementation of Database
* Randomization algorithm that makes random tables

Things that still need work: 
* linking the randomization algorithm with the database that stores table groups

TL;DR: some features are finished, some features are not complete


# Technical Features

### MVC Features
* Algorithm will use MVC by getting user input (student names) through the controller and frontend, and using the algorithm to randomly generate new groups for everyone --> THIS WILL BE THE MAIN PBL FEATURE

Other Features:

### Previous technical Expertise
* Our main technical lead, Yajat, has previous experience working with Databases
* Everyone on our team has experience working with Java and algorithms, which is necessary since the random student algorithm is the main feature we will develop
* Our Design Manager (Devam), will be using bootstrap layouts to make our website look nice.
